        <h3>Research Themes</h3>
        <div class="research-vision">
          <h4><strong>Public and Confidential Data</strong></h4>
          <p>Data sharing and collaboration are increasingly important to enable validation, further research, and joint analysis of multiple datasets. However, these processes are often complicated by limited visibility of public data and confidentiality of private data. I initiated a project to develop platforms and methods for sharing and collaborating on agricultural genome-to-phenome (AG2P) research using both public and confidential data, supported by a USDA-NIFA grant. Our approach includes fostering public data sharing, innovating encrypted data sharing, and enabling collaborative research such as federated and transfer learning. We have developed methods to encrypt genotypes and phenotypes for collaborative analyses and established a Stakeholder Advisory Board to ensure our methods meet the needs of the community.</p>

          <h4><strong>Phenotypes</strong></h4>
          <p>To advance G2P research, I aim to expand the range of phenotypes studied beyond traditional numerical traits. This "End-to-End Genomic Prediction" initiative focuses on the direct prediction of images and text from DNA markers. By incorporating complex phenotypes such as imaging data and textual descriptions, and using advanced computational techniques, I am developing models that can predict these high-dimensional phenotypes directly from genotypic data. This work is being tested in real strawberry breeding programs and aims to revolutionize breeding by improving the efficiency and accuracy of selecting desirable traits.</p>

          <h4><strong>Evolutionary G2P</strong></h4>
          <p>My passion for comparative genomics was ignited by a project published in <em>Cell Genomics</em>, where we developed a deep learning-based approach to understand genomic conservation at the functional level between species. I am now collaborating to further investigate evolutionary traits, such as brain size, by incorporating various functional annotations and developing new methods. By bridging deep learning, comparative genomics, and quantitative genetics, we aim to uncover fundamental biological mechanisms and evolutionary patterns.</p>

          <h4><strong>Animal Quantitative Geneticist</strong></h4>
          <p>I am pursuing an initiative called "AHA" (Animal to Human, Human to Animal), focusing on the bidirectional application of methodologies between human and animal genetics. This includes adapting cutting-edge human genetics methods for animal genetics applications, such as SBayesRC and TWAS, to account for differences in genetic architectures. These efforts bridge the gap between human and animal genetics and have the potential to drive innovation across both fields.</p>

          <h4><strong>Impact and Vision</strong></h4>
          <p>Through these research directions, my overarching vision is to advance the field of G2P studies into a new era of integration and innovation. I aim to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how genomes influence phenomes across different contexts and scales, ultimately transforming our approach to genetics and genomics research and its applications in agriculture, medicine, and beyond.</p>
